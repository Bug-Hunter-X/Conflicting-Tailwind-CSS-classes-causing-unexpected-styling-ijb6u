# Conflicting Tailwind CSS classes causing unexpected styling

This repository demonstrates a bug where conflicting Tailwind CSS classes lead to unexpected styling in the generated CSS.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when using multiple Tailwind classes that conflict or have unexpected interactions. In the provided example, several classes are used, but there's a conflict between some of them that leads to an unexpected result.  The issue doesn't always trigger an error message from the compiler, but rather results in incorrect visual output.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` which contains a simple HTML element with Tailwind CSS classes.
3. Observe the rendered output in your browser. The styling will likely be different from the expected result.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the Tailwind CSS classes and their potential conflicts.  It often requires understanding the order of precedence and how classes modify or override each other.  In this case, a proper investigation of the conflicting classes is necessary and possible solutions might involve removing unnecessary classes, using utility-first classes instead of custom ones or using specific modifiers to control the layering and precedence of classes.
